> Use case: illustration-story. Asset type: one transparent sprite sheet for a gentle toddler web game. Create exactly two separate, fully visible cats on a true transparent background, arranged horizontally with a broad clear transparent gap between them so the two silhouettes can be cropped and animated independently. In the left half, a small cream-and-ginger kitten stands facing right; in the right half, its slightly larger loving mother cat stands facing left. Their faces are at similar height and their paws rest naturally; both have soft tabby markings, kind relaxed eyes, tiny warm smiles, and rounded friendly proportions. Keep each cat centered inside its own half with comfortable transparent margins; no overlap or touching. Match a soft watercolor picture-book style with subtle paper grain, warm chestnut-brown hand-painted outlines, bright gentle colors, and the rounded friendly finish of the existing local game art. Keep anatomy simple and appealing for a three-year-old. No background, ground plane, cast shadow, text, collar, accessories, props, extra animals, border, or watermark.
